v0.1.0, 2022-08-30

https://github.com/boxyhq/awesome-oss-devsec[‚≠ê Star us on GitHub]

List of awesome open-source developer security tools. Maintained by https://boxyhq.com[BoxyHQ], and heavily inspired by https://mvsp.dev/mvsp.en/index.html[MVSP].

It includes security principles and controls relevant to popular compliance certifications (like ISO27001, SOC2, MVSP, etc.). Also check this list of link:COMPLIANCE.adoc[popular compliance frameworks and certifications]
