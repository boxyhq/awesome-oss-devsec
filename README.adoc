Developer Security Mesh
=======================
BoxyHQ team <hello@boxyhq.com>
v0.1.0, 2022-08-30

DevSecMesh is our upcoming product to automate security in all parts of your tech stack. By combining Security as Code, security playbooks, compliance controls and some incredible open-source security tools DevSecMesh provides complete automation of your product security. Think of it as an extension of your security team or your security team if you don't have one.

In the meantime we have curated a list of awesome developer-first security principles for your product. And a set of free OSS tools to use for it where applicable. It is heavily inspired by https://mvsp.dev/mvsp.en/index.html[MVSP], a minimum security baseline for enterprise-ready products and services. Our missions align and we have recently joined their working group.

Designed with simplicity in mind the checklist contains security controls, their description, relevance to popular compliance certifications (like ISO27001, SOC2, MVSP, etc.) and open-source tools you can readily use to automate it.

Shift-left security allows developers to keep pace with agile development and continuous deployment but it's simply not enough to provide tools that are designed for security teams. What is needed instead is developer tools built for security, allowing developers to built secure products without adding additional work.

We'd love your feedback and contributions to this list. Please submit an issue, PR or reach out to us at devsecmesh@boxyhq.com

Here's a list of link:COMPLIANCE.adoc[popular compliance frameworks and certifications].
